********* comment utiliser la matrice sur des shapes ccad?
  ******** _gp.gp_Trsf()
    ******** cf. _translate() for example

Deplacement des anchors lors des dÃ©placements dus au contraintes
  -> fonctions de transformation sur les nodes

******** rotation et translation autour des ancres

Custom serialization and deserialization

******** Format for STEP + anchors

-> Assemblies in assemblies in assemblies ...
      Document the code
      Clean
      More complex case -> rc car?
      ******** GeometryNode -> One class with multiple constructors

New anchors concept (normal + tangent)

Class diagram

---- >  Naming of assemblies and nodes that are translatable in various languages

******** Avoid duplication of STEP/STEPZIP loading


-----


******** rename shape on nodes to node_shape for clarity
******** shape returned by an assembly? -> ccad Solid(compound)

is it useful to keep the initial placement of nodes?

******** separate examples for assemblies of each part of the car, and for assemblies of assemblies

******** move _transform_anchors from nodes to geometry

******** wx viewer should be part of osvcad (coming from aocutils)
  ******** AUI or split window for UI (shelf + 3d + graph)
  Remove dependency of osvcad.ui.topology on aocutils
  integrate the graph viewer
  Set the assembly in the model to do the first tests
  callbacks for selections in the ui
  * MVC pattern using Atom + move away from calling the UI in nodes or assemblies
  Anchors display (and selectable)
    How to display a relationship that is not made of 2 vectors ??
  Live part coding (editor and viewer side by side)

---- >  nicer graph presentation

really global assembly of Tabby as an example

include some parts (motor) in the car example that are created from python scripts

Notion of Assembly in ccad should disappear?
